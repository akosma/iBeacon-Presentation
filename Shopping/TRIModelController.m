At the same time, slightly updated versions of the previous 13- and 15-inch unibody models were announced that will sell in parallel. While dimensionally smaller than its predecessor, the similarly styled third generation model still retains a unibody form factor. Specification-wise, the most substantial differences in the next-generation MacBook Pro are the fitting of a significantly higher resolution Retina display, the elimination of the optical drive, and replacement of hard disk drives with solid-state drives. A third generation 13-inch MacBook Pro was released on October 23, 2012. As with the 15-inch, it includes a Retina display.",

The Raspberry Pi is manufactured in two board configurations through licensed manufacturing deals with Newark element14 (Premier Farnell), RS Components and Egoman. These companies sell the Raspberry Pi online. Egoman produces a version for distribution solely in China and Taiwan, which can be distinguished from other Pis by their red coloring and lack of FCC/CE marks. The hardware is the same across all manufacturers. The Raspberry Pi has a Broadcom BCM2835 system on a chip (SoC), which includes an ARM1176JZF-S 700 MHz processor, VideoCore IV GPU,[12] and was originally shipped with 256 megabytes of RAM, later upgraded to 512 MB. It does not include a built-in hard disk or solid-state drive, but it uses an SD card for booting and persistent storage.",

Unveiled during a keynote on October 22, 2013, the iPad Air features the 64-bit Apple A7 processor along with a M7 coprocessor. The iPad Air marks the first major design change for the iPad since the iPad 2; it now features a thinner design that is 7.5 millimetres thick and has a smaller screen bezel similar to the iPad mini. Apple reduced the overall volume for the iPad Air by using thinner components resulting in a 25% reduction in weight over the iPad 2. Though it still uses the same 9.7-inch Retina display as the previous iPad model, an improved front-facing camera makes using FaceTime much clearer. The new front facing camera is capable of video in 720p HD, includes face detection, and backside illumination. The rear camera received an upgrade as well; now being called the iSight camera, in addition to the same functions as the front camera it also contains a 5MP CCD, hybrid IR filter and a fixed Æ’/2.4 aperture.",
